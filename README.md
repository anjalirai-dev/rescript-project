This is the github repo from where I get the inspiration to setup the project: https://github.com/bloodyowl/rescript-react-starter-kit

## Commands
--> After cloning the package, in your terminal, hit this command "npm install".
If this command doesn't work then try this one: "npm install --legacy-peer-dependency"
Once this is done, in another terminal. hit "node server/server.mjs"
and your localhost will be started
